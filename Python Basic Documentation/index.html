            Python is a computer programming language often used to build 
			websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. 
			Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to 
			create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for 
			any specific problems. This versatility, along with its 
			beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming 
			languages today.

			Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, 
			task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. 
			Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted 
			by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, 
			for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

            “Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,”

			Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write 
			programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living 
			to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun 
			to helping someone else solve a problem.”

            Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward 
			syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate 
			(prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" 
			directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a 
			newline, unlike in C).

          <p id="p_9">
            Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no 
			command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the 
			moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need 
			to be declared with any particular type, and can even change 
			type after they have been set. Variable names are case-sensitive. 
			Example: x = "Sally"
          </p>
          <p id="p_10">
            If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be 
			done with casting. Example: x = str(3)
          </p>
          <p id="p_11">
            You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
          </p>
          <p id="p_12">
            String variables can be declared either by using single or 
			double quotes. 
          </p>

          <p id="p_13">
            In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables 
			can store data of different types, and different types can do 
			different things.
          </p>
          <p id="p_14">
            Python has the following data types built-in by default, in 
			these categories:
          </p>
          <ul id="ul_2">
            <li id="li_6">Text Type:	str</li>
            <li id="li_7">Numeric Types:	int, float, complex</li>
            <li id="li_8">Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range</li>
            <li id="li_9">Mapping Type:	dict</li>
            <li id="li_10">Set Types:	set, frozenset</li>
            <li id="li_11">Boolean Type:	bool</li>
            <li id="li_12">Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
            <li id="li_13">None Type:	NoneType</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="conditionals">
        <header class="titulos" id="conditionals_6">Conditionals</header>
        <p id="p_15">
          Conditional statements are an essential part of programming 
		  in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on the 
		  values of variables or the result of comparisons.
        </p>
        <p id="p_16">
          The most common way to use conditionals in python is with <em id="em_2">IF Statements</em>. 
        </p>
        <p id="p_17">
          The if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a 
		  certain condition is true. For Example: 
        </p>
        <code id="c_2">if x > 5:</code>
        <blockquote id="quote_2">
          print("x is bigger than 5")         
        </blockquote>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="loops">
        <header id="loops_7" class="titulos">Loops</header>
        <article id="main_article_6">
          <p id="p_19">
            Python has two primitive loop commands:
          </p>
          <ul id="ul_3">
            <li id="li_14">while loops</li>
            <li id="li_15">for loops</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="p_20">
            With the while loop we can execute a set of statements 
			as long as a condition is true. Remember to increment i, 
			or else the loop will continue forever. With the break 
			statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition 
			is true. With the continue statement we can stop the 
			current iteration, and continue with the next. For Example:
          </p>
          <code id="c_3">i = 1</code>
          <code id="c_4">while i < 6:</code>
          <blockquote id="quote_4">
            print(i)
            <br id="br_1">
            i += 1
            <br id="br_2">
            if i == 4:
            <blockquote id="quote_5">break</blockquote>
            if i == 2:
            <blockquote id="quote_6">continue</blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <p id="p_23">
            A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 
			(that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a 
			set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword 
			in other programming languages, and works more like an 
			iterator method as found in other object-orientated 
			programming languages. With the for loop we can execute 
			a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, 
			set etc. For Example:
          </p>
          <code id="c_5">fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            <br id="br_3">
for x in fruits:</code>
          <blockquote id="quote_7">print(x)</blockquote>
